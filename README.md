Info about creative portion
1. bookmarking - We implemented code that allows users to bookmark a story. This bookmarked story then shows up under the users profile in a section called "your bookmarks". 
2. notifications about comments - We implemented code to notify a user when a comment appears on a story that the user wrote. In the users profile there is a section that called "new comment notifications", which indicates how many new comments you haveon your story. The user then has the option to mark all as seen to make the new notifications go back down to zero. 
3. like/dislike button - We implemented code to include a like/dislike button at the end of every story.
